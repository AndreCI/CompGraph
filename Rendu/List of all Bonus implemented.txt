Computer Graphic : list of all the features we implemented beyond the minimum requirement

-Water : If the height is below 0.2, we added water. The water is animated and there are reflect.

-Rivers : We added some rivers to our landscape. They are calculated using the gradient descend algorithm.
The animation is not that good, we wanted to add some particle to have a better rending but didn't manage to add them in time.

-We tried also a lot of others features, but we didn't manage to implent them.
The following were considered : adding particle, a shadowmap, making the terrain rolling under the feet of the user to make it seems endless, fog, and mostly we tried to create an "mars"-like landscape, by adding canyon procedural generation, additional texture, volcano, procedural lava texture generation...
We run out of time so we can't present you the project, we drop it 3 weeks ago.

Split of work : 
We used a github where any of us could create a new issue. The idea was that the issues were linked to a milestone (Part 1, 2 or 3) and to the labels "enhancement" (i.e. it is beyond the minimum requirement), and "bug"
Then, any of us could go and assign itself to an issue, depending on his competences and willingness to work on it.
This didn't work as we intend to, probably because of a lack of communication between our teammembers. Max & André ended up working much than Youssef, espcially on the bonus issues.
